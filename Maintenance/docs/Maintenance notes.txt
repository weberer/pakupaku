List of issues found that can be worked on

1: GameView.cs has too much logic and should be rebased.

2: Dimes are still spawing when the slot is empty, even if the game is freshly launched.

3: Bullets will cause a line of bullets when the space bar is held down, until the left or right arrow keys are pressed.
4: Score on the main screen seems to be high scores, but isn't noted as such.

5: Bounding box on coins is a tad bit too large, spanning from the left corner of the screen to the center of the joystick, and fom the base
of the tank to the bottom of the joystick base. 
5.1: The coins also will clip into the game screen, causing up to half of the coin to be overwritten with the start screen. After hovering 
the mouse over the game's form the coin will be stuck in place until the mouse is out of the game's form.

6: Once you are in the game you cannot exit the game unless you restart the game, regardless on the number of credits in the machine.
6.1: High scores are getting added to the system, but they aren't visable until the game is restarted due to this.
6.2: They have a timer to blink the game over message, but after the message is finished the game is stuck on the ghosts.

7: Only valid controls are left arrow, right arrow, and space. This could be expanded on.

8: We can expand on some of the tests. Currently some of the classes are not tested fully. These are: Bullet.cs and SpaceShip.cs. Bullet.cs is
missing a test to check that each bullet type is working properly, and SpaceShip.cs is missing a test for the initial construction of the
ship.
8.1: JoyStickTests seems to be completely arbitrary, with it only consisting of setters and getters being tested.

9: The alien bullets can graze through the side of the shield without the bullet being caught by the shield. This has been seen on the far
right shield's left side so far.

10: Holding a coin will cause the ship and aliens to freeze when a direction is held down. The length of how far they will move varies, but
it's within the range of 1/8 to 1/4 of the screen
